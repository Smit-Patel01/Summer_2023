As of September 2023,

There are a total of 3 individual structures for 2D.
Structure 1 - All values
Structure 2 (L1 = 0)
Structure 3 (L1 = L3 = 0)

Currently, we have all three structures individually trained and tested on various datasets.
To reduce computational costs, we have reduced the wavelengths to 15%. 
We used to train the models with only 2 epochs in the past, but now the usual training epoch number is 1000. 
We have increased the number of hidden layers in the neural network while keeping the shape (kite) the same. 
Neuron sizes are as follows: 
6 100 200 400 400 800 800 800 400 400 200 200 100 100 50 20 4.


1st combined model
It is the combination of Structure 1 and Structure 2.
Total Data Size - 22000 Rows (11K - S1 and 11K - S2)

2nd Combined model
It is the combination of Structure 1, Structure 2, and Structure 3.
Total Data Size - 33000 Rows (11K - S1 | 11K - S2 | 11K - S3)


We often experiment with:

Number of epochs
Number of layers
Number of neurons in each layer
Ensembling and averaging


All the files are uploaded to the Box folder. 
Each .py file in the folder contains the code for the cloud, and once the model is generated, we can test and visualize the performance using (Test__.ipynb files). 
I am uploading samples of both files on GitHub for future reference. 
Data Sweep is the file used when we want to generate data size vs. loss box plots. 
The "Rest" folder contains all the worst-performing models on 2 epochs. 
The main crux of the project can be found in the "2_1000 Epochs" folder. 
There is no need to retrain already trained models, as the history has been saved in each subfolder, and testing can be started directly.
